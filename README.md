# minimaless

It's like [minima](https://jekyll.github.io/minima/), but less. ✨

![minimaless screenshot preview](/screenshot.png)

See the [demo site](https://brettinternet.github.io/minimaless/). Follow these steps to [setup](/setup.md) your own Jekyll site with this theme.

The gem is found [here](https://rubygems.org/gems/minimaless).

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "minimaless"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site:

```yaml
theme: minimaless
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle


## Features

### Includes

Refers to snippets of code within the `_includes` directory that can be inserted in multiple layouts (and another include-file as well) within the same theme-gem.

  - `disqus_comments.html` &mdash; Code to markup disqus comment box.
  - `footer.html` &mdash; Defines the site's footer section.
  - `google-analytics.html` &mdash; Inserts Google Analytics module (active only in production environment).
  - `head.html` &mdash; Code-block that defines the `<head></head>` in *default* layout.
  - `header.html` &mdash; Defines the site's main header section. By default, pages with a defined `title` attribute will have links displayed here.
  - `contact-icons.html` &mdash; Inserts social icons when you specify a social media site `*_username` in the config.
    - You can also add an `.asc` file for a key icon to appear for users to download your GPG key file.

## Usage

### Customization

To override the default structure and style of minimaless, simply create the concerned directory at the root of your site, copy the file you wish to customize to that directory, and then edit the file.
e.g., to override the [`_includes/head.html `](_includes/head.html) file to specify a custom style path, create an `_includes` directory, copy `_includes/head.html` from minimaless gem folder to `<yoursite>/_includes` and start editing that file.

The site's default CSS has now moved to a new place within the gem itself, [`assets/main.scss`](assets/main.scss). To **override the default CSS**, the file has to exist at your site source. Do either of the following:
- Create a new instance of `main.scss` at site source.
  - Create a new file `main.scss` at `<your-site>/assets/`
  - Add the frontmatter dashes, and
  - Add `@import "minimaless";`, to `<your-site>/assets/main.scss`
  - Add your custom CSS.
- Download the file from this repo
  - Create  a new file `main.scss` at `<your-site>/assets/`
  - Copy the contents at [assets/main.scss](assets/main.scss) onto the `main.scss` you just created, and edit away!
- Copy directly from Minimaless gem
  - Go to your local minimaless gem installation directory ( run `bundle show minimaless` to get the path to it ).
  - Copy the `assets/` folder from there into the root of `<your-site>`
  - Change whatever values you want, inside `<your-site>/assets/main.scss`
- Edit index.md to change what appears on the site's splash/landing page.

### Enabling comments (via Disqus)

Optionally, if you have a Disqus account, you can tell Jekyll to use it to show a comments section below each post.

To enable it, add the following lines to your Jekyll site:

```yaml
  disqus:
    shortname: my_disqus_shortname
```

You can find out more about Disqus' shortnames [here](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466208).

Comments are enabled by default and will only appear in production, i.e., `JEKYLL_ENV=production`

If you don't want to display comments for a particular post you can disable them by adding `comments: false` to that post's YAML Front Matter.

--

### Enabling Google Analytics

To enable Google Anaytics, add the following lines to your Jekyll site:

```yaml
  google_analytics: UA-NNNNNNNN-N
```

Google Analytics will only appear in production, i.e., `JEKYLL_ENV=production`
