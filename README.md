# minimaless

It's like [minima](https://jekyll.github.io/minima/), but less. ✨


## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "minimaless"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site:

```yaml
theme: minimaless
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle


## Features

### Includes

Refers to snippets of code within the `_includes` directory that can be inserted in multiple layouts (and another include-file as well) within the same theme-gem.

  - `disqus_comments.html` &mdash; Code to markup disqus comment box.
  - `footer.html` &mdash; Defines the site's footer section.
  - `google-analytics.html` &mdash; Inserts Google Analytics module (active only in production environment).
  - `head.html` &mdash; Code-block that defines the `<head></head>` in *default* layout.
  - `header.html` &mdash; Defines the site's main header section. By default, pages with a defined `title` attribute will have links displayed here.
  - `icon-* files` &mdash; Inserts github and twitter ids with respective icons.

## Usage

### Customization

To override the default structure and style of minima, simply create the concerned directory at the root of your site, copy the file you wish to customize to that directory, and then edit the file.
e.g., to override the [`_includes/head.html `](_includes/head.html) file to specify a custom style path, create an `_includes` directory, copy `_includes/head.html` from minima gem folder to `<yoursite>/_includes` and start editing that file.

The site's default CSS has now moved to a new place within the gem itself, [`assets/main.scss`](assets/main.scss). To **override the default CSS**, the file has to exist at your site source. Do either of the following:
- Create a new instance of `main.scss` at site source.
  - Create a new file `main.scss` at `<your-site>/assets/`
  - Add the frontmatter dashes, and
  - Add `@import "minima";`, to `<your-site>/assets/main.scss`
  - Add your custom CSS.
- Download the file from this repo
  - Create  a new file `main.scss` at `<your-site>/assets/`
  - Copy the contents at [assets/main.scss](assets/main.scss) onto the `main.scss` you just created, and edit away!
- Copy directly from Minima 2.0 gem
  - Go to your local minima gem installation directory ( run `bundle show minima` to get the path to it ).
  - Copy the `assets/` folder from there into the root of `<your-site>`
  - Change whatever values you want, inside `<your-site>/assets/main.scss`

### Enabling comments (via Disqus)

Optionally, if you have a Disqus account, you can tell Jekyll to use it to show a comments section below each post.

To enable it, add the following lines to your Jekyll site:

```yaml
  disqus:
    shortname: my_disqus_shortname
```

You can find out more about Disqus' shortnames [here](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466208).

Comments are enabled by default and will only appear in production, i.e., `JEKYLL_ENV=production`

If you don't want to display comments for a particular post you can disable them by adding `comments: false` to that post's YAML Front Matter.

### Enabling Google Analytics

To enable Google Anaytics, add the following lines to your Jekyll site:

```yaml
  google_analytics: UA-NNNNNNNN-N
```

Google Analytics will only appear in production, i.e., `JEKYLL_ENV=production`
